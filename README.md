# Dotfiles repo

This repo contains the default configuration for all my dotfiles, plus a series of python scripts that modify these configurations to be specific to a given theme.

The main configurations with everything that is consistent across themes (keybindings, vim plugins, etc.) is located in `./default_configs/`. 

Theme specific configs are located in `./themes/<theme_name>/<theme_name>.json`. `./themes/<theme_name>/` also contains any specific files that are meant to overwrite the default configs.
